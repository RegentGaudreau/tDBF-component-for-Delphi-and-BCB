TODO:

to be implemented:
- extend copyfrom functionality to copy between 2 active databases
- better copyfrom; append to table, little different fields
- global cache for dbfs, indexes
- flush method to commit buffers to disk
- required field checking
- demo needs master/detail example
- documentation needs expression index examples
- val function for indexes
- retrieve temporary filenames used in restructuretable
- foNoPartialCompare in filter
- autoinc field support for visual foxpro

needs fixing:
- lazarus projects need unit ideintf when dropping tdbf on forum
- unix character set conversion is a mess
- check paged cache flushing, recordcount in cache
- adding records without doing CancelRange causes assertion violation
- adding records while filter active causes autoinc fields not to be filled in
- exception safe freeing of items in TOCollection.FreeItem

bug reports:
- wimb\app0018

TODO (PaulenAndrew):

Collaborate with lploeger on release 7.0

Pending for lploeger
- Commit changes for demo
- Confirm that r588 fixes "How to sort data" > "Demo 'index'" > "Sort by title (NDX)"

Demo
- Added TDbf Demo 1.3.6 to trunc/demo
- Consider dropping version number and including as part of release
- "How to search using filter" > "Search author" "L". Finds "Kylie Minogue", whereas expected "L.A.X".
	Still don't think r578 is correct
		If loPartialMatch is used and there is no exact match, it should find the least key that is greater.
		This should remain the same even if index is descending. Descending only means negate all comparisons. "Kylie Minogue" is not less than "L", it is greater than "L".	
		Does not handle the case where EntryNo = LowIndex
		Should not negate Result
- "How to search using index" > "Demo 'index'" > Rebuild Indexes > sharing violation.
	Exclusive behaviour changed was fixed in r337, but demo depends on old behaviour
- Rich text not displayed correctly in "What is tDbf", "How does that work  *", "How to search using index *", "How to filter data *", "Compatibiliy *" and "Calculated fields *". Related to bad index?
- Unexpected horizontal scroll bar. Consider ""DBGrid1.Columns[0].Width := 200;" in TMainForm.FormCreate.

Documentation
- Added TDbf documentation 1.1 to trunk/doc
- Consider replacing with OpenDocument format file
