TODO:

to be implemented:
- extend copyfrom functionality to copy between 2 active databases
- better copyfrom; append to table, little different fields
- global cache for dbfs, indexes
- flush method to commit buffers to disk
- required field checking
- demo needs master/detail example
- documentation needs expression index examples
- val function for indexes
- retrieve temporary filenames used in restructuretable
- foNoPartialCompare in filter
- autoinc field support for visual foxpro

needs fixing:
- lazarus projects need unit ideintf when dropping tdbf on forum
- unix character set conversion is a mess
- check paged cache flushing, recordcount in cache
- adding records without doing CancelRange causes assertion violation
- adding records while filter active causes autoinc fields not to be filled in
- exception safe freeing of items in TOCollection.FreeItem

bug reports:
- wimb\app0018

TODO (PaulenAndrew):

Collaborate with lploeger on release 7.0

Demo
- "How to search using filter" > "Search author" "L". Finds "Kylie Minogue", whereas expected "L.A.X".
	Still don't think r578 is correct
		Complicated by the fact that it gives a result even though there is no partial match in this case!
		If loPartialMatch is used and there is no exact match, it should find the least key that is greater.
		This should remain the same even if index is descending. Descending only means negate all comparisons. "Kylie Minogue" is not less than "L", it is greater than "L".	
		Does not handle the case where EntryNo = LowIndex
		Does not handle the case where there are multiple instances of previous key
		Should not negate Result
		What is a descending index on AUTHOR proving here? Just change it to ascending?
		A robust way to do what Lennert suggests is to start at the end and go backwards, without negating comparisons. But, then you may as well use an ascending index.
- Demo new features (if significant)

Documentation
- Update version/author name/date
- Document new features
- Remove old features (eg. UseFloatFields)
- Review todo.txt

Files
- TDbf Win32_Linux should be renamed Win_Linux, as it is also applicable to Win64, or renamed OS neutral
- Prepare tdbf700.tar.bz using http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gtar.htm and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bzip2.htm?
	.tar.gz would be better for Linux - http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gzip.htm
- Prepare tdbf700.zip using http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zip.htm?
- Do not need separate demo and documentation, as this is now in the repository and will be part of the archive
