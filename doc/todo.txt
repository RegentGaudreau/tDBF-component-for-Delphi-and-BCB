TODO:

to be implemented:
- extend copyfrom functionality to copy between 2 active databases
- better copyfrom; append to table, little different fields
- global cache for dbfs, indexes
- flush method to commit buffers to disk
- required field checking
- demo needs master/detail example
- documentation needs expression index examples
- val function for indexes
- retrieve temporary filenames used in restructuretable
- foNoPartialCompare in filter
- autoinc field support for visual foxpro

needs fixing:
- lazarus projects need unit ideintf when dropping tdbf on forum
- unix character set conversion is a mess
- check paged cache flushing, recordcount in cache
- adding records without doing CancelRange causes assertion violation
- adding records while filter active causes autoinc fields not to be filled in
- exception safe freeing of items in TOCollection.FreeItem

bug reports:
- wimb\app0018

TODO (PaulenAndrew):

Collaborate with lploeger on testing/fixing demo
- Consider adding demo to repository
- "How to sort data" > "Demo 'index'" > "Sort by title (NDX)" > Not sorted! Side effect of r355.
- "How to search using filter" > "Search title" "L". Finds "Kylie Minogue", whereas expected "L.A.X".
- "How to search using index" > "Demo 'index'" > Rebuild Indexes > sharing violation. Exclusive behaviour changed in 7.0 but is correct. 
- Rich text not displayed correctly in "What is tDbf", "How does that work  *", "How to search using index *", "How to filter data *", "Compatibiliy *" and "Calculated fields *". Related to bad index?
- Unexpected horizontal scroll bar. Set “DBGrid1.Columns[0].Width := 200;” in TMainForm.FormCreate?

Collaborate with lploeger on release candidate for version 7.0:

Subversion
	src
		[X] Update TDBF_MAJOR_VERSION, TDBF_MINOR_VERSION and TDBF_SUB_MINOR_VERSION constants
	doc
		[X] Update History.txt
Files
	TDbf Win32_Linux/
		Should this be renamed Win_Linux, as it is also applicable to Windows x64?
	TDbf 7.0/
		tdbf700.tar.bz
			There is no documentation on how to create this file (maybe involves Linux, tar, bzip)
		tdbf700.zip
			There is no documentation on how to create this file (maybe involves Windows, unknown ZIP client)
	TDbf Demo App/
		Need demos for new features
		Should this be under source control? Currently, it is not
		Should this be integrated into the archive of the release?
			The problem currently is that it is separate and gets an unrelated version number
	TDbf Documentation/
		Needs documentation for new features
		Should this be under source control? Currently, it is not
		Should this be an OpenDocument format file?
			The problem currently is that the PDF is difficult to edit and there is no source file
		Should this be integrated into the archive of the release? This would be simpler
